		(Single) Pointer

1. We use pointer to store the address of a variable.
2. Initialize the pointer like this following:
        int x = 4; (simple varialbe)
	int *pointerOfX; (pointer variable)
 	pointerOfX = &x; (pointing the address of x variable)

3. Print the value from pointer like this:
	cout<<*pointerOfX; 
      (how to read this symbol (*)  for pointer)
	is
      Value at (pointer variable name (x) is 4)

4. How to change the x value using pointer following:
       we have x = 4; (we want to make it 5) using pointer we create above
       *pointerOfX = 5;
       if we cout the x it is change to 5;
	cout<<x; (answer: 5)

5. If we want to print pointer own address that contain another variable address following:
	cout<<"Address is "<<&pointerOfX;

		(Double) Pointer

1. Initialization
	int **pointer;
	
    for example:
	int x = 4;
	int *singlePointer = &x;
	int **doublePointer = &singlePointer;

	cout<<*doublePointer;(it print the address of x (which means *doublePointer = &x ))
	cout<<**dobulePointer;(it print the value of x (which means **doublePointer = x ))
